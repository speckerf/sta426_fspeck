_Create an HTML document that samples 100 values from a log-normal
distribution (say, mu=1, sigma=.25); create a histogram of the distribution and
the distribution on the log scale; report the mean and variance of the sample in
line in the text. In general, do not just dump the R code and plots in the HTML
document; break your exercises into sections with headings, add some text
and make it readable._


#### Draw 100 values from a log-normal distribution
```{r log-normal}
x <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
```

#### Histogram of the distribution

```{r}
hist(x)
hist(log(x))
```

#### Mean and Variance of the distribution
The mean of our sample is `r round(mean(x), 3)`, while the variance is `r round(var(x), 3)`.
